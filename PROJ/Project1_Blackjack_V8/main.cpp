         * this program simulates the rules of blackjack according
         * to the blackjack minigame found in the 2006 playstation 2
         * game "GOD HAND", a game i have played a lot.
         * http://tinyurl.com/ds4nyvvk
         * 
         * these are not casino rules by any means - but i find them
         * to be more fun because the player is slightly more at an
         * advantage than in a true game of casino blackjack.
         * 
         * these rules mean that the maximum number of cards that
         * can be used in one hand is 9, which would occur if the
         * player stands on 4 cards before the dealer wins with
         * a five-card charlie.
         * 
         * this is why N_DEAL == 9, and the loop below generates
         * 9 unique cards to use during the current hand.
         * 
         * the player could cheat by reading crdStrs.dat as they
         * play, but if they're playing this game in an IDE like
         * my professor will, they could already cheat anyway.

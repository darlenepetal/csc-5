    /* in (this version of) blackjack, the player automatically
     * wins the hand if they are dealt 5 cards without busting.
     * this is called a "5-card charlie" and is controversial.
     * http://tinyurl.com/y6pv4mjz
     * 
     * this program simulates the rules of blackjack according
     * to the blackjack minigame found in the 2006 playstation 2
     * game "GOD HAND", a game i have played a lot.
     * http://tinyurl.com/ds4nyvvk
     * 
     * these are not casino rules by any means - but i find them
     * to be more fun because the player is slightly more at an
     * advantage than in a true game of casino blackjack.
     * 
     * these rules mean that the maximum number of cards that
     * can be used in one hand is 9, which would occur if the
     * player stands on 4 cards before the dealer wins with
     * a 5-card charlie.
     * 
     * this is why N_DEAL == 9, and the loop below generates
     * 9 unique cards to use during the current hand.
     * 
     * the player could cheat by reading crdStrs.dat as they
     * play, but if you're playing this game in an IDE like
     * my professor will, you could already cheat anyway
